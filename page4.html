A simple, and common, definition of a crossover would be that it is a vehicle that combines the features of an SUV and a hatchback. Crossover vehicles offer soft-roading capabilities and are constructed like a car - they use unibody construction instead of the body-on-frame platform used in SUVs.

Examples of crossovers: Maruti Suzuki S-Cross, Volvo S60 Cross Country, Hyundai i20 Active, etc.</p>
